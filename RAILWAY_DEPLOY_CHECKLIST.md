## Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment - pre-trained CIFAR-10 CNN classifier"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy to Railway
# - Go to railway.app
# - Create new project
# - Deploy from GitHub repo
# - Wait for build completion

# 3. Test deployment
# - Open Railway URL
# - Verify model info loads
# - Test random image prediction
# - Check training plots display
```

## Expected Performance

- **Startup Time**: 30-45 seconds (TensorFlow + model loading)
- **Memory Usage**: ~400MB (CNN model + TensorFlow)
- **Test Accuracy**: High accuracy on CIFAR-10 (see model info)
- **Available Test Images**: 200
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for predictions

## Post-Deployment Testing
